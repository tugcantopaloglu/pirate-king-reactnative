# Project Progress Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the progress made in the SkullKing project, including completed tasks, implemented features, and the current state of the workspace. It is intended to help future sessions or collaborators continue seamlessly from this point.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Project Scaffolding**:

   - React Native client (`SkullKingClient`) and Node.js + Express server (`SkullKingServer`) were set up.

2. **Core Game Engine**:

   - Implemented the core game engine logic for bidding, trick resolution, and scoring in `gameEngine.js`.

3. **Local Pass & Play**:

   - Integrated the game engine with the React Native client for local multiplayer functionality.
   - Added `LocalPassPlayScreen` in `SkullKingClient`.

4. **Online Multiplayer**:

   - Added WebSocket support to the server using `socket.io`.
   - Integrated WebSocket client in `SkullKingClient`.

5. **Interactive Tutorial**:

   - Created an interactive tutorial screen (`TutorialScreen.tsx`) in the React Native client.

6. **Leaderboards & Achievements**:

   - Implemented endpoints for leaderboards and achievements in `leaderboards.js`.
   - Verified functionality of `/leaderboards` and `/leaderboards/achievements` endpoints.

7. **Customization & Theming**:

   - Added a customization screen (`CustomizationScreen.tsx`) in the React Native client for selecting card backs, table skins, and avatars.

8. **Assets Organization**:
   - Created an `assets/` folder in `SkullKingClient` for client assets (e.g., cards, backgrounds, avatars).
   - Created a `public/images/` folder in `SkullKingServer` for server assets.

## Current Workspace Structure

### SkullKingClient

- Contains the React Native client application.
- Key files and folders:
  - `App.tsx`: Main entry point with navigation.
  - `LocalPassPlayScreen.tsx`: Screen for local multiplayer.
  - `TutorialScreen.tsx`: Screen for the interactive tutorial.
  - `CustomizationScreen.tsx`: Screen for customization options.
  - `assets/`: Folder for storing client assets (e.g., cards, backgrounds, avatars).

### SkullKingServer

- Contains the Node.js + Express server application.
- Key files and folders:
  - `app.js`: Main server file with route and WebSocket setup.
  - `routes/`: Folder containing route files (`gameEngine.js`, `leaderboards.js`, etc.).
  - `public/images/`: Folder for storing server assets (e.g., static images).

## Next Steps

- Add actual game assets (e.g., card images, background images) to the `assets/` folder in `SkullKingClient` and `public/images/` in `SkullKingServer`.
- Test the full integration of client and server features.
- Optimize performance and polish the UI.
- Add any additional features or enhancements as needed.
